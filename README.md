# decentralised e - library

## 📚 Project  

The **decentralised e - library** is a blockchain-based digital library system designed to manage book access and user registrations transparently and securely. It allows the addition of digital book records stored via IPFS and enables access for registered users without relying on a central authority.

## 🌟 Project Vision

To create a censorship-resistant, accessible, and trustless system for managing digital libraries, empowering global access to educational and literary resources through decentralized technology.

## 🔑 Key Features

- 📖 **Book Registry**: Add books to the decentralized library with metadata and IPFS content hashes.
- 👥 **User Management**: Register users to access book information securely.
- 🔎 **Book Lookup**: Query book details by ID.
- 🔐 **Access Control**: Only the contract owner (admin) can add books or register users.

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Integration with IPFS gateways for actual content retrieval.
- Role-based access (e.g., students, publishers, librarians).
- Token-based or subscription access models.
- Frontend interface (DApp) for user-friendly interaction.
- NFT issuance for unique books or limited editions.
